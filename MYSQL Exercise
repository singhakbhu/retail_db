1.	In retail_db database, we have 2 tables:  orders and order_items

    For all CLOSED orders, get revenue.

    Steps:
    Orders.order_id is mapped to order_items.order_item_order_id
    Sum order_items.order_item_subtotal to get revenue


Solution 1: 
    select o.order_id, t.revenue from 
    orders o join 
    (select order_item_order_id,sum(order_item_subtotal) revenue from order_items group by order_item_order_id)t 
    on t.order_item_order_id=o.order_id 
    where o.order_status="CLOSED" limit 10;
